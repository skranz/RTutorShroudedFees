# More detailed description
new_open_no | the number of new open-end funds started in month t. 
new_closed_no | the number of new closed-end funds started in month t.
new_open_amt | the amount of money allocated by new open-end schemes in millions of 2009 U.S. dollars.
new_closed_amt | the amount of money collected by new closed-end schemes in millions of 2009 U.S. dollars.
net_flow_open_amt | the net flows to open-end funds calculated as the flows into new and existing open-end funds minus outflows of existing funds = *new_open_amt* + *ex_open_amt* - *open_red*. 
net_flow_closed_amt | the net flows to closed-end funds calculated as the flows into new and existing closed-end funds minus outflows of existing funds = *new_closed_amt* + *ex_closed_amt* - *closed_red*.
starts | the observed number of opened or closed funds started in month x year t.
time_trend | a time trend variable that starts with 0 for our first observation, increasing by one for each subsequent *month_year*.
sensex1_return | the one month lagged return of the BSE Sensex index in *month_year* t. That is, e.g., the one month lagged return in April 2006 is the actual return observed one month earlier, in March 2006.
sensex3_return | the three month lagged return of the BSE Sensex index in *month_year* t. That is, e.g., the three month lagged return in April 2006 is the actual return observed three months earlier, in January 2006.
regime2 | a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the observation is from Regime 2.
regime3 | the Regime 3 dummy.
closed | a closed dummy that equals 1 if the respective fund is a closed-end fund.
closed_regime2 | a so-called interaction between *closed* and *regime2*, that only equals 1 if both *closed* and *regime2* are equal to 1.
closed_regime3 | the interaction between the closed and the Regime 3 dummy variables.
open_raw | the average of *open_monthly_raw_return*,
closed_raw | the average of *closed_monthly_raw_return*,
open_marketadj | the average of *open_monthly_raw_return* mean_sensex_monthly*
closed_marketadj | the average of *closed_monthly_raw_return* mean_sensex_monthly*.
open_monthly_raw_return | monthly return on open-end funds.
closed_monthly_raw_return | monthly return on closed-end funds. 
mean_sensex_monthly | monthly return on the BSE Sensex Index used as a proxy for the market return. Multiply the columns with 100 to get the percentage return per month.
cmo_return | *closed-excess* minus *open-excess*, used as the performance of closed-end funds compared to open-end funds.
closed_excess | close-end funds' excess return calculated as raw return minus risk-free rate (*monthly_bill*).
open_excess | open-end funds' excess return calculated as the raw return minus risk-free rate.
